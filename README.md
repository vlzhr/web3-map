# Web3.0 journey

Nowadays there are many educational sources about blockchain, Ethereum and entire Web 3.0, but it's hard to## structure it and find the way to start using the technology. In this work I've tried to build journeys for users depending on their wishes.

### Investors

How to invest in crypto w/o huge risks?

### Traders

How to start earn and make x2 monthly (or lose everything)? 

### Developers

How to build dApps and blockchain-based products?

### Entrepreneurs

How to build business using Web3 technologies or empower the existing one?

## Here is a solution
